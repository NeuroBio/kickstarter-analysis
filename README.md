# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

A analysis of questionably real kickstarter campaigns to help decidedly fake Louise make decisions on how to perform one US play kickstarter fundraising campaign and, potentially, a GB musical kickerstarter fundraising campaign.

## Premise:
Louise would like to successful fund her US play production, _Fever_.  Should this be successful, she would then seek to fund a GB musical idea.
Using data from past kickstarter campaigns, we seek to advise her on the differences between successful and failed theater kickstarter campaigns so she can make decisions to improve her chances of success.

## Results:

### US Theater and Plays
Theater is the most populus US kickstarter category, and theater campaigns have a high rate of success relative to other kickstart campaign catagories, though music is the most successful catagory **(Fig. 1)**.  Taking a deeper look at the theater subcategories show that plays are the most common US theater campaign subcategory **(Fig. 2)**.  Interestingly, there was a spike in the likelihood of success for theater kickstarter campaigns that began in May **(Fig. 3)**.  For comparison, successes and failures rise at a similar rate for campaigns begun in April, suggesting that there is simply an increase in the number of theater campaigns in April.  This success spike in May tapers off as the year progresses, reaching its lowest point in December.

Examing the fund raising goals and pledges for US plays data visually is difficult, because the bulk of the data is compressed into a small area of the chart, by a small number of high goal kickstarters **(Fig. 4)**.  However, the bulk of successful theater fundraising campaigns had lower fund raising goals than failed campaigns **(range Successful: 1.5-5K$, range failed: 2-10K$, Table 1)**.  Louise's budget is therefore outside the typical range for successful campaigns.  Interestingly, despite asking for less money, successful campaigns tended to earn greater pledges than failed campaigns.  This shows that campaigns did not earn comenstorate pledges to successful campaigns and subsequently fail simply because their goals were higher.

### GB Theater and Musicals:

Musicals are the most popular subcategory in the theater catagory for Great Britain **(Figure 5)**.  Comparing the goals of these campaigns to the pledge amount shows that the bulk of the pledges are less than 2KGBP, which is less than half of Louise's proposed budget **(Fig. 6)**.  Of the five plays Louise had expressed interest in, three of the five had goals of 2KGB and four earned more than that amount **(Table 2)**.  This values would place them among the most successful musical kickstarter campaigns.

## Conclusions:
Louise's instinct to use kickstarter is correct.  Plays in the US **(Fig. 1)** and musicals in Great Britain **(Fig. 5)** are highly successful kickstarter topics.  Given the increased likelihood of success for theater fundraising campaigns launched in May **(Fig 4)**, I would highly advise that Louise prepare for a May launch date, or if necssary, June.  However, Louise's funding goals may need to be altered.  Her goal for Fever is 10K$, which is well outside the typical pledge range for US plays **(Table 1)**.  In fact, the majority successful campaigns pledge less than 6K$ **(Table 1)**, so I would advise that Louise find a way to decrease her budget significantly.  If this cannot be done, a more in depth analysis on the behavior of successful US play campaigns with high funding goals will be required to give better recomendations on how to market these larger fundraisers.  The data on campaigns from Great Brittain tells a similar story.  Louise's buget of 4KGB is more than double what 75% of musical campaigns are able to pledge **(Fig. 6)**.  Furthermore, the data suggest that using the Edinburgh plays as research for Louise's musical may be misguided.  If those plays were musicials, they would have been highly successful outliers **(Table 2 and Fig 6)**; they are not representative of the behavior for typical GB musical kickstater campaigns.
